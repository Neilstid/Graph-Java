Graph solver
============

This application is for creating graph (oriented or non oriented) and apply then some algrithm (like Dijkstra, DFS, ...).

Usage
-----

When you will have launched the program, you will find the next interface :

![empty interface](./image_ReadMe/empty_interface.PNG?raw=true "Empty graph application")

You can then create by hand your graph (by adding edge and vertex) or asking the application to create a new random one or a complete graph.

![complete interface](./image_ReadMe/complete_graph.PNG?raw=true "Complete graph")

Finaly you can apply some of algorithm :

![Dijkstra algorithm](./image_ReadMe/Dijkstra.PNGraw=true "Djkstra algorithm")

Installation
------------

To run this application you will need to install before JavaFX an linked JavaFX to this application. Then you can run the main.java in package application.
